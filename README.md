### Example
If not otherwise specified the requested sprites will be renderered as an APNG animation of the first action (0, Stand).

**Render monster with id 1001 (Scorpion) with action 0 (Stand, default)**  
`./zrenderer --job=1001`  
Result: ![Scorpion](examples/1001_0.png)

**Render frame 10 of the monster with id 3000 (Necromancer) of action 16 (Attack)**  
`./zrenderer --job=3000 --action=16 --frame=10`  
Result: ![Necromancer](examples/1870_16_10.png)

**Render character with id 4012 (Sniper), action 17 (Sit) while looking to the left (indicated by frame 2)**  
`./zrenderer --job=4012 --action=17 --frame=2`  
Result: ![Sniper](examples/4012_17_2.png)

**Render character with id 1 (Swordman), action 32 (Ready) with headgears 4 (Flower), 125 (Blush), garment 1 (Wings), weapon 1 (Sword), head 4 and gender female.**  
`./zrenderer --job=1 --headgear=4,125 --garment=1 --weapon=2 --head=4 --gender=female --action=32`  
Result: ![Swordman](examples/1_32.png)
## Server
`./zrenderer-server -h`
```
Same as CLI
```
The server will listen on the _hosts_, bind to _port_ and write its logs to _logfile_.
### API
The server will provide one API endpoint:

| Endpoint | Method | Content-Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| /render | POST | application/json |

#### Request
The endpoint accepts a request in json format with the following attributes:

| Attribute | Required | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| job | Yes | string array |
| action | No | number >= 0 |
| frame | No | number |
| gender | No | string |
| head | No | number >= 0 |
| garment | No | number >= 0 |
| weapon | No | number >= 0 |
| shield | No | number >= 0 |
| bodypalette | No | number |
| headpalette | No | number |
| enableshadow | No | boolean |
| headgear | No | number > 0 array |

Note that the attribute names are identical to the options one and so is their function and meaning as well as defaults.

#### Response
The following responses may be returned by the server

| HTTP Status | Content-Type | Body | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 200 | application/json | `{"output": ["0_1.png", "1_2.png", ...]}` | JSON Object with one attribute called "output". The output attribute contains an array of filenames of the generated sprites. |
| 400 | text/plain | \<error message> | Returned when the request is invalid. |
| 500 | text/plain | \<error message> | Returned when an error occurred. |

#### Example

`POST /render`
```json
{
    "job": ["1001", "1005"],
    "action": 16,
    "frame": 2
}
```
`200 OK`
```json
{
    "output": [
        "output/1001_16_2.png",
        "output/1005_16_2.png"
